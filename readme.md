by (Samar Osailan)

Dataset

> The dataset GoFordBike contains 158168 trips data for Bay Wheels's Ford GoBike described as rows with 13 features described as columns which are: 1- Bike ID 2- Bike type 3- Start Time and Date 4- End Time and Date 5- Start Station Name 6- Start Station ID 7- End Station Name 8- End Station ID 9- Start Station Latitude 10- Start Station Longitude 11- End Station Latitude 12- End Station Longitude 13- User Type (Subscriber or Customer  Subscriber = Member or Customer = Casual)

Summary of Findings

> After exploring the features affect on the duration of trips, I found that the user and bike types have more effect on the duration.

Key Insights for Presentation

Trip duration distribution:
> The trip duration feature is calculated from the start and end time of the trips in the dataset, And its distirbution is right skewed where the number of trips started to increase from about 45000 to a peak of 50000 and then it starts to fall down under 10000 for more than 2000 seconds.

User Type distribution:
> User type distribution shows that casual users got a higher percentage

Bike Type distribution
> Bike type distribution shows that electric bikes got a higher percentage

The relationship between the trip duration and the user type
> The distirbution shows that member users mostly got a shorter trip duration while casual users vary from short to long trips.

The relationship between the trip duration and the bike type
> The distirbution shows that electric bike mostly got a shorter trip duration while docked bike vary from short to long trips.
