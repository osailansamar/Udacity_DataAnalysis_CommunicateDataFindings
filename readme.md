## by (Samar Osailan)


## Dataset

> The dataset GoFordBike contains 158168 trips data for Bay Wheels's Ford GoBike described as rows with 13 features described as columns which are: 1- Bike ID 2- Bike type 3- Start Time and Date 4- End Time and Date 5- Start Station Name 6- Start Station ID 7- End Station Name 8- End Station ID 9- Start Station Latitude 10- Start Station Longitude 11- End Station Latitude 12- End Station Longitude 13- User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual)


## Summary of Findings

> First of all, I started to explore some features that can affect the trip duration, which are the user and bike types, start and end stations. I found that there's no appeared effect from the start and end stations, while the user and bike types showed a huge effect on the duration of the trip.

> In conclusion, I found that the member user type and electric bike type got shorter trips duration than others.
